# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI) data using Python. It includes data processing, visualization, and statistical insights into air quality trends.

## Features
- Data Loading: Reads AQI data from a CSV file.
- Missing Value Handling: Identifies and fills missing values.
- Statistical Summary: Generates key insights about AQI trends.
- Data Visualization:
  - AQI Distribution Plot
  - AQI Trend Over Time (if the dataset contains date information)
  - AQI Variation by Location (if location data is available)

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run
1. Place your AQI dataset (CSV file) in the same directory as the script.
2. Update the `file_path` variable with the correct file location.
3. Run the script using:
```bash
python air_quality_analysis.py
```

## Expected Outputs
- Console Output: Data preview, missing values, and statistical summary.
- Plots:
  - Histogram of AQI distribution
  - Line chart of AQI over time (if applicable)
  - Boxplot of AQI variation by location (if applicable)

## Dataset Assumptions
- The dataset should contain an `AQI` column.
- If time-based analysis is needed, a `Date` column should be present.
- If location-based analysis is needed, a `Location` column should be present.

## Notes
- The script automatically handles missing values by filling them with the mean.
- Ensure the date format is correct before running the script.
